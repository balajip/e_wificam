[2011/09/09]
Fix mshc_test hang problem.
 1. The init-flow of integrated MMC subsystem will affect the operation of SD flow in mshc_test.c.
 2. Rewrite mshc_test.c. Use the write/read functions of MMC subsystem in the test flow.
    This will make sure that the SD init flow of Uboot is consistent in everywhere.
 3. Add udelay(5000) in write flow of func mmc_send_cmd(drivers/mmc/VN_mmc.c).
    This will solve that SD fails to read data if it reads data after write op immediately.

[2011/08/24]
Released Version. 1.18
1. Add support for BCM54616 on MozartV2.

[2011/08/19]
1. Integrate MMC subsystem to this version.
 - Now we can read/write MMC via the standard interface provided by Uboot MMC subsystem.
 - We keep the command "sdread" for backward compatibility.
 - The rest part of old SD code are marked as "Obsolete".
 - Force 100Mbps when Mozart325/330.

[2011/08/05]
Released Version. 1.17
1. Add support for IC+1001 RGMii 1Gbps mode for MozartV2.

[2011/08/04]
Released Version. 1.16
1. Fix the bugs of gmac_test.c
   - We should add the mask to read the IP1001 ID.
     This is because the last bit of ID is the revision number.
     So we have to read the masked ID to omit the revision number.
2. Add GMACInit_v2()
   - The flow of original GMACInit() was too complicated and messy.
     It was hard to read and maintain the code.
     Now we add more conditional code fragment to handle the situation of Mozart V2.
     This makes the situation worse.

     To end the chaos, I decide to rewrite the function.

     Now I have two functions GMACInit_v1() and GMACInit_v2().
     Like the meanings of names, one handles MozartV1 and the other is charge of MozartV2.
     The content of GMACInit_v1() is the same as the original GMACInit().
     I just add a new function GMACInit_v2().
     GMACInit_v2() is the refined and simplified version of GMACInit_v1().

     In the future, I hope to integrate GMACInit_v1() and GMACInit_v2().
3. Add GMAC test under 1Gbps mode
4. Refine nand flash quick-test

[2011/07/18]
Released Version. 1.15
1. Add support for Mozart V2 IC+101/1001 network driver.

[2010/12/02]
1. Rename audio_test.c(now it is audio_test_SSM2603.c).

7. Chnage the location of GMAC Desc/Buf.
   The original offset is 0x02000000(32MB).
   Its new offset will be located at location followed the STACK area.
   And the value will be counted automatically.
8. Print the U-Boot reserved dram area when booting.
   Also adds a new command "reserved" to print the reserved area.
   Now the user can use the info to avoid polluting the required space of U-Boot.

1. Add RS485 quick test.
2. Refine the configure file mozartevm.h
