1. What's that?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The PCI Utilities package contains a library for portable access to PCI bus
configuration registers and several utilities based on this library.

In runs on the following systems:

	Linux		(via /sys/bus/pci, /proc/bus/pci or i386 ports)
	FreeBSD		(via /dev/pci)
	NetBSD		(via libpci)
	OpenBSD		(via /dev/pci)
	GNU/kFreeBSD	(via /dev/pci)
	Solaris/i386	(direct port access)
	Aix		(via /dev/pci and odmget)
	GNU Hurd	(direct port access)
	Windows		(direct port access)

It should be very easy to add support for other systems as well (volunteers
wanted; if you want to try that, I'll be very glad to see the patches and
include them in the next version).

The utilities include:  (See manual pages for more details)

  - lspci: displays detailed information about all PCI buses and devices.

  - setpci: allows to read from and write to PCI device configuration
    registers. For example, you can adjust the latency timers with it.
    CAUTION: There is a couple of dangerous points and caveats, please read
    the manual page first!

  - update-pciids: download the current version of the pci.ids file.


2. Compiling and (un)installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just run "make" to compile the package and then "make install" to install it.

If you want to change the default installation location, please override
the PREFIX variable specified in the Makefile -- e.g., you can use
"make PREFIX=/opt/pciutils install" to create a separate installation
not interfering with the rest of your system.  Setting the DESTDIR variable
will allow you to install to a different directory from the one you intend
to eventually run it from.  This is useful for people who are packaging
pciutils to install on other computers.

The configure script will automatically enable support for a compressed
pci.ids if you have zlib installed.  You can override its guess by using
"make ZLIB=no" or "make ZLIB=yes".  If compressed support is enabled,
pciutils will use pci.ids.gz in preference to pci.ids, even if the
pci.ids file is newer.  If the pci.ids.gz file is missing, it will use
pci.ids instead.

When you are bored of dumping PCI registers, just use "make uninstall".


3. Getting new ID's
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The database of PCI ID's (the pci.ids file) gets out of date much faster
than I release new versions of this package.

If you are missing names for any of your devices or you just want to stay
on the bleeding edge, download the most recent pci.ids file from
http://pciids.sf.net/ (e.g., by running the update-ids utility).

If your devices still appear as unknown, please send us their ID's and
names, the detailed instructions for submissions are listed on the
sf.net web page.


4. Getting new versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New versions of pciutils are available at the following places:

	ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/linux/pci/
	ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/utils/pciutils/ (expect a couple of hours delay)
	ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/hardware/ (expect a couple of days delay)

There is also a public GIT tree at:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/pciutils/pciutils.git


5. Using the library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is still no documentation for the library, if you want to use it
in your programs, please follow the comments in lib/pci.h and in the
example program lib/example.c.


6. Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have any bug reports or suggestions, send them to the author.

If you have any new ID's, I'll be very glad to add them to the database, but
please take a look at http://pciids.sf.net/ first and follow the instructions.

If you want, subscribe to linux-pci@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz (send
"subscribe linux-pci" to majordomo@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz).
Release notes about new versions will be send to the list and problems with
the Linux PCI support will be probably discussed there, too.


7. Miscellanea
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You also might want to look at the pciutils web page containing release
notes and other news: http://mj.ucw.cz/pciutils.shtml .

There also exists a utility called PowerTweak which is able to fine tune
parameters of many chipsets much better than the Bridge Optimization code
in Linux kernel (already removed in 2.3.x). See http://powertweak.sf.net/
for more information.

					Have fun
