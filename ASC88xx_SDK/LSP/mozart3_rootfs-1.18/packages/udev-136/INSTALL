Usual options for udev installed in the root filesystem are:
  ./configure
    --prefix=/usr
    --exec-prefix=
    --sysconfdir=/etc
For 64bit multilib-installations also:
    --with-libdir-name=lib64
For SELinux support:
    --with-selinux

All options:
  --prefix=
      Prefix for man pages, include files.
  --exec-prefix=
      Prefix for libs, binaries, usually the root filesystem.
  --with-udev-prefix=
      Prefix for internal udev path names, like /dev/, /lib/udev/.
      Only useful for testing and development installations. The
      value is copied from exec-prefix, if not specified otherwise.
  --sysconfdir=
      Usually /etc.
  --with-libdir-name=
      Directory name for libraries. This is not a path name.
  --enable-debug
      Compile-in verbose debug messages. Usually not needed,
      it increases the size of the binaries.
  --disable-logging
      Disable all logging and compile-out all log strings. This
      is not recommended, as it makes it almost impossible to debug
      udev in the running system.
  --with-selinux
      Link against SELInux libraries to set the expected context
      for created files.

The options used in a RPM spec file usually look like:
  --prefix=%{_prefix}
  --exec-prefix=
  --sysconfdir=%{_sysconfdir}
  --with-libdir-name=%{_lib}
  --with-selinux

The defined location for scripts and binaries which are called
from rules is /lib/udev/ on all systems and architectures. Any
other location will break other packages, who rightfully expect
the /lib/udev/ directory, to install their rule helper and udev
rule files.

It is recommended to use the /lib/udev/devices/ directory to place
device nodes, directories and symlinks, which are copied to /dev/
at every bootup. That way, nodes for devices which can not be
detected automatically, or are activated on-demand by opening the
pre-existing device node, will be available.

Default udev rules and persistent device naming rules are required
by other software that depends on the data udev collects from the
devices, and should therefore be installed by default with every udev
installation.
