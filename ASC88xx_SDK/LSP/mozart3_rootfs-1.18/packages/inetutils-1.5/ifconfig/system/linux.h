/* The RX/TX statistics would have to be parsed from /proc/net/dev,
   which is in an insanely broken format, even for Linux standards.
   Parsing correctly from it in all cases is impossible because device
   names are truncated to six characters (linux-2.4/net/core/dev.c).
   Nevertheless it can be attempted in the future (check for unique
   abbreviations of interfaces with long names).  Aliases are not listed
   there, instead, the aliases statistics are collected in the real
   inetrface. See ipchains(1) for how to get them. */
