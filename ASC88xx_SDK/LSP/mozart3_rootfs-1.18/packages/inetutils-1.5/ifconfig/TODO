* Before release:

** Implement flags support in changeif.c and options.c
** Fix and move if_index.c to libinetutils.
** Port to BSD.
** Make sure it is a drop in replacement at least for the most
   common options on Linux and BSD.

* Some systems can provide more interfaces than
  SIOCGIFCONF/if_nameindex, interfaces which are usually not UP but
  registered nevertheless.
  (linux: /prov/net/dev). Some support for that?

* Honour IFF_CANTCHANGE when working in flag setting in brdaddr,
  dstaddr, etc.

* We could put the option parsing (invocation of getopt_long) into a
  function like parse_opt_rest, which could be used by
  system_parse_opt_rest to continue parsing the options as usual after
  processing a non-option.

* Is it necessary to merge long/short options intelligently?
  For example, if a system specific option shadows a normal option?
  Allow this?
