This is a test release of this package.  Bugs are now handled through
bug-inetutils for both released and unreleased versions of this
package.

If you see a problem that you've already reported, feel free to
re-report it -- it won't bother me to get a reminder.  Besides, the
more messages I get regarding a particular problem the sooner it'll be
fixed -- usually.  If you sent a complete patch and I didn't apply it
or get back to you, please let me know.

Please send comments and problem reports to bug-inetutils@gnu.org.

Snapshots can be obtained at ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/cvs/inetutils.tgz

The code is also available through anonymous CVS.  Set your CVSROOT
string to:

:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/inetutils

Hit enter when prompted for a password

issue:

cvs co inetutils.

There is a script called "autogen.sh" which will setup all of
the automatically created scripts for you.  You need automake and
autoconf for this to work.

You can track the CVS process through the mailing list:
commit-inetutils@gnu.org

This is a medium volume moderated list.
