.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Syslogd
reads and logs messages to the system console, log files, other
machines and/or users as specified by its configuration file.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl V
Print version number and exit.
.It Fl -help
Display help information and exit.
.It Fl d
Enter debug mode. syslogd does not put itself in the background, does
not fork and shows debug information.
.It Fl a
Specify additional sockets from that syslogd has to listen to.
This is needed if you are going to let some daemon run within
a chroot()'ed environment. You can specify up to 19 additional
sockets.
.It \fB-f\fR, \fB--rcfile\fR=\fIFILE\fP
Specify the pathname of an alternate configuration file;
the default is system specific and displayed in the help output.
.It \fB-h\fR, \fB--hop\fR
Enable forwarding remote messages. By default syslogd will not
forward messages it receives from remote hosts.
.It Fl l
A colon-seperated lists of hosts which should be considered local;
they are logged by their hostnames instead by their FQDN.
.It \fB-m\fR, \fB--mark\fR=\fIINTERVAL/fP
Select the number of minutes between ``mark'' messages;
the default is 20 minutes. Setting it to 0 disables timestamps.
.It \fB-n\fR, \fB--no-detach\fR
Suppress backgrounding and detachment of the daemon from its
controlling terminal.
.It \fB-p\fR, \fB--socket\fR=\fIPATH\fP
Specify the pathname of an alternate log socket.
The default is systemspecific and displayed in the help output.
.It \fB-r\fR, \fB--inet\fR
Enable to receive remote messages using an internet domain socket.
The default is to not receive any messages from the network. Older
version always accepted remote messages.
.It Fl s
A colon-seperated list of domainnames which should be stripped from
the FQDNs of hosts when logging.
.It Fl -no-klog
Do not listen to the kernel log device. This is only supported on
systems which define a kernel log device, on all others this is already
the default, and the option will be silently ignored.
.It Fl -no-unixaf
Do not listen to any unix domain socket. This option overrides \-p and \-a.
.It Fl -no-forward
Do not forward any messages. This overrides \-h.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Syslogd
reads its configuration file when it starts up and whenever it
receives a hangup signal.
For information on the format of the configuration file,
see
.Xr syslog.conf 5 .
.Pp
.Nm Syslogd
reads messages from the
.Tn UNIX
domain socket
.Pa /dev/log ,
from an Internet domain socket specified in
.Pa /etc/services ,
and from the special device
.Pa /dev/klog
(to read kernel messages).
.Pp
.Nm Syslogd
creates the file
.Pa /var/run/syslog.pid ,
and stores its process
id there.
This can be used to kill or reconfigure
.Nm syslogd .
.Pp
The message sent to
.Nm syslogd
should consist of a single line.
The message can contain a priority code, which should be a preceding
decimal number in angle braces, for example,
.Sq Aq 5.
This priority code should map into the priorities defined in the
include file
.Aq Pa sys/syslog.h .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/syslog.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/syslog.conf
The configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/syslog.pid
The process id of current
.Nm syslogd .
.It Pa /dev/log
Name of the
.Tn UNIX
domain datagram log socket.
.It Pa /dev/klog
The kernel log device.
