/* Building filesystem for VN Mozart3 Chip EVM */

usage:
1. source devel_mozart120
[1.1 change your own setting in static/etc]
[1.2 change the ramdisk size FSSIZE in make_rootfs.sh]
2.sudo ./make_rootfs.sh

This script will produce
1. rootfs.sqfs for squashfs
2. rootfs.cpio for initramfs
3. ramdisk.image.gz as an ordinary compressed ramdisk

For squashfs, burn the rootfs.sqfs into the address of rootfs in flash
(default setting at 0x200000 from start of serial flash)

For initramfs, just put rootfs.cpio to linux-2.6.x/usr/rootfs.cpio
then use menuconfig to set initramfs source to ./usr/rootfs.cpio
note that the file name must be ended with .cpio
