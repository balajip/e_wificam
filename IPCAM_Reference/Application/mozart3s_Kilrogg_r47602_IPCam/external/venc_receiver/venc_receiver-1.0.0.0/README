README for venc_receiver_SampleApp

SYNOPSIS
  ----------------
  This sample program shows you how to retrieve the video bitstream from "venc" of Kilrogg(reference software) 
  The sample program also dump the bitstream to files.

  We will use two IPCs between receiver application and venc:
   -- FIFO           : for command communication between process, 
   -- SharedBuffMgr  : for bitstream sharing between process, ex venc and rtsps

  The operations of a receiver program need to do
   1. Send start command message to venc with reqired stream number.
      looping from setp 2 to step 4
   2. Request the buffer from ShardBuffMgr
   3. Do you operation on the buffer, ex. dump bitstream to file or others.
   4. Release the buffer to ShardBuffMgr
   5. Send stop command message to venc when you don't need stream.
