This sample code shows how to get the encoded bitstream form aenc process through Unix domain socket and FIFO IPCs.

The aenc uses FIFO to receive command from other process such as rtsp server and
use Unix domain socket to send encoded bitstream to other process.

FILES:

aenc_receiver.c  -- sample code to get bitstream and dump to file.

SockSrc.c        -- A module which provide some API to establish socket and fifo
UnixSockUtil.c   

These two file also be used in rtsp app.


Build:
    make clean
    make

Usage:
    1. Stop rtsp and aenc
      /etc/init.d/rtspsd stop
      /etc/init.d/aencd stop
    2. execute sample code
       ./aenc_receiver
    3. telnet to EVM/RDK by another session and restart aenc
       /etc/init.d/aencd start
    The aenc_receiver will dump the encoded bitstream to file,
    please make sure that you have the write permission at executing folder.
