autofs is a kernel-based automounter for Linux.  It performs a job
similar to amd(8) but relies on a small stub of kernel code instead of
pretending to be an NFS server.  The result is simpler code, better
reliability, and much faster operation in the common case (everything
already mounted.)

An AMD/AutoFS HOWTO is available at:

http://www.Linux-Consulting.com/Amd_AutoFS/autofs.html

... as well as from your favourite HOWTO archive.

To build autofs, please run:

	./configure

to configure the system.  See README.options for options that you can
give configure.

After configuring, you can:

	make			... make the daemon and modules
	make install		... install the daemon and modules

The kernel code is no longer distributed with the autofs daemon (this
package); it is now only distributed only with the Linux kernel code.
