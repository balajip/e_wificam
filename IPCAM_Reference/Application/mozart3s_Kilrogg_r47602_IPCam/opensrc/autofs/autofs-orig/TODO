autofs v3 TODO list
-------------------
* I am accepting minor changes to autofs v3 such as additional
  modules.  No major changes.

autofs v4 TODO list
-------------------
* autofs 4 is developed by Jeremy Fitzhardinge.  It supports
  multimounts without being quite as radical a departure
  architecturally.

autofs v5 TODO list
-------------------
* Completely rewritten kernel protocol, using the new VFS features
  introduced by Alexander Viro for the 2.4 kernel series.
* Use multithreading rather than processes in the daemon.
* Support multimount entries.  (Quite messy: can't unmount the
  tree as a unit, probably needs locking while constructing the tree,
  and needs scaffolding if no entry for /.  Appears *very* difficult
  to do without threading!)
* /net support: need hostname resolver module (easy) as well as mountd
  query (easy) plus all the multimount entry stuff...
* Direct mount support.
* (Hopefully) some kind of inode spoofing to support browsable
  directories.
